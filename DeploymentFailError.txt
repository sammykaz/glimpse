Problem:

Deployment fails when running Droid Application



Solution:

1. Search Regedit in your computer
2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Android

The path originally was C:\Users[User]\AppData\Local\Android\android-sdk

3. Change to the Path that is set in Xamarin Visual Studio. Go to Tools -> Options -> Xamarin, Click on Change for Android SDK , Copy Path

Path should look like something like this: 
C:\Users[User]\AppData\Local\Xamarin\Universal\AndroidSDK

Paste it in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Android, and changing the SDK path to my Xamarin Mono Android SDK folder.

Run now and it should deploy properly.
